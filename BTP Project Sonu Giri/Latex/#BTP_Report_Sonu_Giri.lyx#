Abstract

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In landscape ecology synthetic 2D landscape generators can be used in theoretica
l models to test ecological processes, models and uncertainty in ecological
 data.
 Ecological studies using real data are restricted by available data and
 the cost of acquiring new data meaning that samples sizes tend to be small
 reducing the possibility of making generalizations.
 Conclusions derived may thus be specific to a particular area described
 by the limited data available.
 Studies that have a large sample size tend to use simulated landscapes
 (e.g.
 Li et al.
 2005).
 In this project we constructed a tool to generate synthetic 2D landscape
 with natural and urban landscapes.
 This tool generates synthetic landscape with various features based on
 the input provided by user.
 In this paper, we describe the algorithms used in the tool to generate
 the landscapes, input parameters for the tool, results obtained, and future
 improvements.

Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Objective
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The objective of this project is to improve on the current suite of synthetic
 landscape simulation software by developing algorithms to randomly generate
 natural features such as vegetation and topographical and hydrological
 features and geometric features such as roads, houses and agricultural
 fields.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Landscape Ecology an overview
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Our world is an increasingly complex system where people, animals, and the
 environment interact on many levels.
 As science has improved and the environmental problems of our world have
 become clearer, a field called landscape ecology has proven extremely important.
 To make it simpler, let us break up the term by looking at both terms separatel
y.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Landscape: Landscape comprises the visible features of an area of land,
 including the physical elements of landforms such as mountains, hills,
 water bodies such as rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements
 of land cover including indigenous vegetation, human elements including
 different forms of land use, buildings and structures, and transitory elements
 such as lighting and weather conditions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Ecology: Used loosely, ecology is the study of the interaction of organisms
 and their non-living environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using these definitions we can describe landscape ecology as a science that
 examines the appearance and patterns of land as a result of the interactions
 with its ecosystems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Uses of Landscape Ecology: Motivation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
There are a wide variety of problems that landscape ecology can address,
 ranging from the effects of global climate change to the management of
 forests for species conservation.
 The demand for ecosystem analysis is growing rapidly as information gathering
 and analysis options are increasing.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The identification and analysis of land use is one area that landscape ecology
 focuses.
 Human use of land in the form of agriculture and urban development plays
 a vital role in the interactions of landscape and ecosystems.
 How land is used may affect the migration of certain animal species as
 well as what land will be available for future use.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Forest management is also a field that landscape ecologists study.
 Many models have been constructed to predict where forests could migrate
 as a result of climate change and human encroachment.
 Landscape ecology has also helped forest managers decide how to use prescribed
 burns to help certain tree species survive.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Invasive species is also a concern of landscape ecology.
 Using mathematical models, remote sensing, and GIS, researchers are able
 to predict where invasive species such as the emerald ash borer, Asian
 long-horned beetle, or honey suckle are most likely to appear next.
 Generally, landscape ecology gives environment managers and administrators
 the information necessary to formulate effective environmental policies
 and programs.

 Springer-Verlag, New York, pp.
 71-113” gives complete mathematical description of algorithms used to generate
 DEM (Digital elevation model), these are fractional Brownian motion algorithm
 (fm2D) and Spectral Synthesis algorithm.
 After reading this paper one can easily implement FM2D or Spectral Synthesis
 method.

Fourier synthesis can also be used to generate landscapes that appear similar
 to FM2D landscape (Keitt 2000).
 This method is commonly used outside of ecology such as for generating
 movie special effects.

Methods for testing how realistic synthetic landscapes
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Part of this project involves quantitatively testing how realistic the landscape
s are and how they compare to current landscape generation methods.
 Li et al.
 (2004) is a good read in regard to this.
 Also Hargrove et al.
 (2002) compared synthetic maps to real by maps by asking over 100 map experts
 to distinguish the real map from the synthetic realization.

Technical definitions, Representation, Algorithms and Use
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Digital elevation models (DEMs) are data sets that represent the elevation
 of the earth’s surface at discrete points in a regular, rectangular grid.
 The intervals between each of the grid points will always be referenced
 to some geographical coordinate system.
 This is usually either latitude-longitude or UTM (Universal Transverse
 Mercator) coordinate systems.
 The closer together the grid points are located, the more detailed the
 information will be in the file.
 The details of the peaks and valleys in the terrain will be better modeled
 with a small grid spacing than when the grid intervals are very large.
 This is referred as DEM cell resolution.
 Elevations other than at the specific grid point locations are not contained
 in the file.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The files can be in either ASCII or binary.
 In order to read the files directly you must know the exact format of the
 entire file layout.
 Usually the name of the file gives the reference location to some map corner
 point in the file.
 The files contain only the z value (elevation value) and do not contain
 the actual geographical location that is associated with that point.
 The actual location associated with that elevation data is calculated by
 software reading the actual DEM file, knowing the precise location of the
 data value inside the DEM file.
 In addition, there will be some needed reference information in the header
 of the file.
 The following is a sample input file to r.in.ascii used by grass to read
 ascii files:

\begin_layout Standard
Fractional Brownian motion (FM2D) and Spectral Synthesis (SS) algorithms
 is used to generate Digital Elevation Model, Both of these algorithms are
 described in Saupe 1988 paper in great detail.
 FM2D is iterative in nature whereas SS is sequential.
 So, FM2D takes a larger time compared to SS to generate a DEM with same
 size and H (auto-correlation factor) value.

Slope in DEM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For each cell, Slope calculates the maximum rate of change in value from
 that cell to its neighbors.
 Basically, the maximum change in elevation over the distance between the
 cell and its eight neighbors identifies the steepest downhill descent from
 the cell.
 Conceptually, the Slope function fits a plane to the z-values of a 3 x
 3 cell neighborhood around the processing or centered cell.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rate of change in the x direction for cell 'e' is calculated with the
 algorithm: The neighbors are identified as letters from 'a' to 'i', with
 'e' representing the cell for which the aspect is being calculated.

Aspect in DEM
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Aspect identifies the down slope direction of the maximum rate of change
 in value from each cell to its neighbors.
 Aspect can be thought of as the slope direction.
 The values of the output raster will be the compass direction of the aspect.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A moving 3 x 3 window visits each cell in the input raster and for each
 cell in the center of the window, an aspect value is calculated using an
 algorithm that incorporates the values of the cell's eight neighbors.
 The cells are identified as letters 'a' to 'i', with 'e' representing the
 cell for which the aspect is being calculated.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The rate of change in the x direction for cell 'e' is calculated with the
 following algorithm:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[dz/dx=((c+2f+i)-(a+2d+g)/(8*x_{cellsize})]

\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[dz/dy=((g+2h+i)-(a+2b+c)/(8*y_{cellsize})]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Taking the rate of change in both the x and y direction for cell 'e', aspect
 is calculated using: 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\begin_inset Formula 
\[
[aspect=57.29578*atan([dz/dy],-[dz/dx])]
\]

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The aspect value is then converted to compass direction values (0–360 degrees),
 according to the following rule:

Decision tree
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A decision tree is a decision support tool that uses a tree-like graph or
 model of decisions and their possible consequences.
 We create a decision tree from the input training data.
 The training data contains a DEM, land-cover class classification and river
 presence and absence information.
 From River presence and absence algorithm we get the river distance matrix.
 The leaf nodes in decision tree represent the land-cover class.
 We query in decision tree just like a binary search tree.
 We use this decision tree to assign land-cover class values to synthetic
 landscape which in turn is used to assign suitability values to each and
 every pixel.

D8 Algorithm (For 3x3 window)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Every pixel is potentially surrounded by eight neighboring pixels.
 The slope in each of these eight directions may be calculated by taking
 the difference in elevation indicated by the DEM value at each of these
 eight neighboring locations and the value at the pixel being examined.
 This difference in elevation is then divided by the center-to-center distance
 between these pixels (this distance will be the cell size in the cardinal
 directions and the cell-size × 
\begin_inset Formula $\sqrt{2}$
\end_inset

 in each of the diagonal directions.
 The direction that yields the steepest downhill slope is the inferred direction
 of water flow.
 (This basic algorithm is sometimes referred to as the D8 method.)

Flow Accumulation (Hydrologic)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Water accumulates along the flow paths dictated by the topography and defined
 earlier as the flow direction.
 Using the flow directions determined earlier, flow accumulation at a given
 location is determined by following two rules:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the pixel has no neighboring pixels draining to it, a value of “1” is
 assigned.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Enumerate
If the pixel drainage from neighboring pixels, it is assigned the value
 of “1” plus the sum of the flow accumulation draining from each of the
 neighboring pixels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Rules 1 and 2 are repeated across the entire DEM.

Erosion Modelling 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Erosion is the process by which soil and rock are removed from the Earth's
 surface by natural processes such as wind or water flow, and then transported
 and deposited in other locations.
 We carry out iterative erosion modelling once we get the flow accumulation
 map.
 It is an iterative process repeated by no of times specified by user.
 Once we erode DEM then again hydrological modelling (flow direction and
 flow accumulation) is performed followed by erosion modelling.
 This process repeats itself the no of times specified by user.

GRASS GIS
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
GRASS GIS (Geographic Resources Analysis Support System) is a free, open
 source geographical information system (GIS) capable of handling raster,
 topological vector, image processing, and graphic data.
 We write python script to use GRASS GIS functions to carry out hydrological
 modelling, finding least cost path.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Algorithm used to generate and place the agricultural patch onto map
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Generate a continuous 'suitability map' to guide placement.
 Areas which match the rules for existing agriculture will have suitability
 100%.
 Other pixels should be labelled according to simple rules e.g., 'slope <
 20%, elevation < x, moisture > y' and weighted by the current land-cover.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Threshold this suitability map at a desired percentage (e.g., 'we want to
 end up with 70% of the landscape covered in agriculture') to discover the
 minimum suitability level to tolerate.
 i.e., if 70% of landscape pixels are above 32% suitability, make this the
 threshold.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Generate the first patch - first, Get a min area, max area, and aspect ratio
 from the user.
 Generate a grid of pixel row- column coordinates for a shape of that aspect
 ratio and required area - e.g., 0,0 to 9,9.
 For the first block, this could be the mean area.
 Subsequent blocks will only ever get smaller, so it could be the max.
 We choose maximum.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Rotate the feature by a random quantity, and recalculate the coordinates
 of the pixels.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Find a highly suitable pixel in the map, and get its row and column coordinate,
 r and c.
 After a few patches have been created, the algorithm should look for suitable
 pixels close to other patches, to mimic spread.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Translate the rotated feature to this location by adding r and c to each
 pixel
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Investigate whether each pixel of the feature now lies in a suitable location.
 Rules for removing that pixel include 'overlaps an existing patch', 'on
 unsuitable habitat' and, optionally, if inter-patch strips are required
 ' <2 pixels from an existing patch) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Count the pixels that remain.
 If these are less than the specified minimum area, don't keep this patch.
 If it's big enough, then give this patch a unique ID, (by labelling all
 the pixels in this or a separate 'patch map' and record its area, perimeter,
 state etc in the patch list.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
If an adjacency matrix is being maintained, update the cells which tell
 us about all the neighbors of this patch.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Calculate the new area covered - if it doesn't meet the stopping threshold,
 continue to create and lay down patches.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Input from parameter File
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
User specify the simulation parameter in a parameter file.
 The program reads the parameter from parameter file and then it starts
 landscape simulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Generation of Digital Elevation Model (DEM)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A DEM is generated either by using Fractional Brownian motion with midpoint
 displacement (midpointfM2D) or Spectral Synthesis (SS) method.
 A set of DEMs are generated which are then linearly combined using a weighted
 ratio specified in parameter file by the user.
 The DEM generation consists of a set of parameter specified by user ,such
 as a list of H (spatial autocorrelation) values, list of H weights, list
 of seed values for random number generator, choice of method used to generate
 DEM, size of DEM, gradient as true or false in case of midpointfM2D.The
 parameter file is described in appendix.
 At the end of this step we get a DEM which is a combination of DEM’s generated
 for given parameters.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
DEM = (DEM1*H_wt1) + (DEM2*H_wt2) + …+ (DEMn*H_wtn)
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Hydrological Modelling and Erosion
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We carry out iterative hydrological modelling using GRASS GIS followed by
 Erosion modelling.
 This process is repeated many times.
 The value of counter in parameter file controls the number of iterations.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Generation of decision tree for land-cover classification
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To assign land cover class to the synthetic DEM, we generate a decision
 tree based on an input elevation map, land-cover map for the elevation
 map and river presence/absence information for each and every pixel.
 Using the elevation map, we calculate slope and aspect map.
 From river presence/absence map, we get city block distance for each and
 every pixel.
 Based on the information (elevation, slope, aspect, river distance, land-cover
 class), we get a decision tree using rpart command in rpy python library.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Land-cover class mapping
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Using the decision tree, we assign the land-cover class to each and every
 pixel of synthetic DEM generated in previous steps by first calculation
 the slope, aspect, and distance from river for synthetic DEM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Generation of geometrical Features
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Once we assign the land-cover classes to each and every pixel, we generate
 an agricultural suitability map.
 The suitability is assigned based on some observation and common sense.
 Once we assign the suitability values then we placed the agricultural patches
 (agricultural fields of a specified aspect ratio, min area and maximum
 area) until we cover specified part/fraction (fraction of area to be covered
 is supplied by the user) of the map.
 After placing all the patches we carry out patch labelling i.e.
 to assign unique ID to each patch.
 The algorithm is described in the chapter 3, section 3.9.
 Once we get all the patches we treat them as a graph.
 We try to connect patches using least cost path.
 After that some patches can be converted to urban settlements.

Improvement in Patch Connectivity

\begin_layout Standard
We use least cost path to connect cluster (set of patches which are close
 to each other) of patches.
 We can treat patches as set of nodes in a graph and then we can connect
 them using least cost path.
 Some patches can be converted to urban features based on suitability rule.
 Patches can be combined based upon requirements.
 Patches can even be more fragmented.
 The figure shown below treat each patch as a node and connect them using
 least cost path.
 The figure is included just to illustrate the idea.
